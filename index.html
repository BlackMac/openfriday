									Every other Friday, every employee at <a href="http://www.sipgate.de/">sipgate</a> 
									is free to do what they think is most valuable for the company. 
									<br><br>
									Additionally we hold an Open Space. It's our preferred way to spread knowledge, solve problems, 
									collect ideas and it replaced most of our meetings.
									<br><br>
									We meet in the morning at 10am for the opening ceremony, followed by five time slots 
									(10:15am, 11:15am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm). At 4pm we meet again for the fabulous closing ceremony 
									during which we summarize each session in a sentence or two.
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									And what's an Open Space?
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									Open Space is a way to spontaneously organize a conference, i.e. create a programme
									for several rooms and timeslots. The programme is created by the participants.
									Everybody who wants to take part - attendance is 100% voluntary -
									gathers for the opening ceremony. The facilitator reads out the theme of this particular
									Open Space, followed by the
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Guiding_principles_and_one_law">Principles and the Law</a>.
									Then the floor opens for participants that want to host a session.
									They write their session topic on a sticky note, briefly introduce their topic and
									then place their session into a time slot and room on a big bulletin board.
									<br><br>
									At the set time and space everyone interested in the topic shows up to discuss it.
									The original suggester has to take notes that are made available to all Open Space participants afterwards.
									<br><br>
									Towards the end, there's 
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									Define "session"...
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									Just about everything can be a session. Some examples for session types and topics:
									<br><br>
									"We want to offer sipgate basic internationally and want to talk about ways to do that and 
									 possible pitfalls. Please come to our session if you've got insights you can share 
									 or are interested in said insights."
									<br><br>
									"We are hosting more and more events. I'd like to create some checklists to make it 
									 easier for organizers. In the session I'd like to go over my draft for a checklist and improve it."
									<br><br>
									"As you may know, my team is building an API. We'd like to show how you can use it 
									 and what customers can do with it. It's tailored for supporters, but everybody's welcome, of course."
									<br><br>
									"Lots of things here work with git, even if they're not development related, e.g. our job offerings. 
									 I've prepared a workshop to teach git basics to non-programmers. Bring your laptop."
									<br><br>
									"Remember the DDoS attack last week? We want to do a retrospective on how we handled it and 
									 what steps to take now."
									<br><br>
									"Kasim and me have just been to Smashing Conf and we want to give you the gist of what we learned."
									<br><br>
									"Next week I'm gonna be at Scrum Day and present about 'Peer Recruiting'. Please come, 
									listen and give me feedback afterwards!"
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									Hm, what's on the sticky notes?
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									Just 2 things: Session title and session host, e.g. "Git for beginners (Aline)".

									Apart from setting the topic, the session host has the sacred duty to document the session 
									for posterity. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									Document it how?
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									Well, whatever floats your boat? What do you already use to share information? Emails? A wiki? Google Docs? 
									We use Yammer (a per-company social network), because we use it for lots of other purposes, too. 
									<br><br>
									What matters is that it's central - known to and accessible for all. Searchability is a big plus.
									<br><br> 
									The documentation itself is usually a short summary, sometimes photos of whiteboards and some such. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									Sounds really nice! But we don't have time.
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									You can start much smaller than "every other Friday for a full day". Why not start with 
									half a day, once. That will give you three 1hour slots to try out Open Space. If
									it doesn't work in your organization, it didn't cost much. If it does work and adds value 
									it will become easier to get another event approved. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									What if nobody pitches a session?
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									Highly unlikely! Whether you're worried or not, there are a couple of things to can 
									do before the first Open Space to make success even more likely:
									<br><br>
									1) Educate your colleagues about what's to come, e.g. with this 
									 <a href="http://wall-skills.com/2014/open-space-technology/">1-pager!</a>. Or visit 
									 a BarCamp to see Open Space mechanisms at work. 
									<br><br>
									2) Ask a couple of people to pitch a session so that others will follow their example 
									 and there's no awkward pause in the beginning.
									<br><br>
									3) Make "So, you got an idea for a session to pitch on Friday?" your conversation starter. 
									 For this to work, you have to be genuinely curious about the answer!
								</p>
								
								<h3 class="text-left">
									Okay, sold! Now, what do we need?
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									Not much. Just a location, board, big sticky notes, pens, 3.5 hours and people willing to try.
								</p>

								<h3 class="text-left">
									Contact
								</h3>
								<p class="text-left">
									We'd love to learn how it works for you! How many people are you? How did it work?
									What surprised you? Any tips for others? We,
									<a href="mailto:openfriday@sipgate.de">Stefan and Corinna, would love to hear your story!</a>

									<strong>We love Open Friday, but we're very few people...</strong>
									<br><br>
									What itch do you want to scratch with Open Friday? Depending on your needs, several 
									ideas come to mind: For instance, having fewer time slots or brown bag lunches with 
									rotating speakers (internal or external) or teaming up with another small company to 
									reach critical mass.
									<br><br><br>
									<strong>Help, we have remote employees. Now, what?</strong>
									<br><br>
									Tricky! Do you have times when you all meet? Maybe you can utilize these. 
									<br><br>
									Others have one laptop per remote worker that their on-site colleagues carry around 
									for them. At the very least they can attend and in the best case they can even host 
									a session (if their on-site buddy handles the sticky business for them. Pun intended :). 
									<br><br><br>
									<strong>Your question is still unanswered?</strong>
